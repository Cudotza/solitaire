# solitaire

# in this project we have to make a working solitaire that has multiple different classes
# we use most of these classes in the solitaire class
# we won't have much code in main since we are just running the game and making it work
# my main problems are that I am not able to format the toStrings for tableau right for ex:
# XXX XXX XXX XXX D03
# XXX XXX XXX S12
# and so on, I am not able to show only top card and have other cards shown, let alone show any cards at all
# and I am also not able to show any foundation cards
